  title : "A Philosopher Turned Entrepreneur"
  content : "Odds are, if you found us, you probably found us through our founder, Baer Lanfried, somewhere on the internet. 
  <br><br>
  Upon finishing his Philosophy MA in Ethics, Baer wanted to find a way help the individual and mom-and-pop succeed against big business.
  <br><br>
  He decided to use his skills in philosophy and programming to create something beneficial that every entrepreneur needs, websites.
  <br><br>
  He recognized that larger businesses always have the upper hand in this regard due to their ability to spend immense capital toward a custom-branded professionally coded website.
  <br><br>
  With this in mind, his goal was to create affordable high-end websites, tailored to specific brands, whilst making the process as simple and personable as possible. Thus, Osows.
