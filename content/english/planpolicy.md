## What This Document Covers
Upon payment for an Osows Plan, and thereby agreeing with our Terms of Service, you also agree to the terms laid out in this Plan Policy.

These terms, developed below, cover our ["**Professionally Coded Website Policy**"](#1-professionally-coded-website-policy), ["**Website Management Policy**"](#2-website-management-policy), ["**Refunds and Cancellation Policy**"](#8-refunds-and-cancellation), as well as any additional purchases ("add-ons" or "additional subscriptions") that may be added onto the original "Plan" purchase and the terms which go along with each additional purchase. By "Plan" it is meant the original Osows [**"Professionally Coded Website"**](#1-professionally-coded-website) Plan, which is the base of all other additional subscriptions or add-ons. In order to purchase additional subscriptions, like [**"Website Management"**](#2-website-management) or add-ons, one must have either paid for the Plan "in Full" (see section 1) or currently be on or finished with the "One Year Payment Route" (OYPR) regarding the Plan (see section 1). An "add-on" is an addition to the Plan and constitutes a *one-time purchase* (i.e., not a recurring payment, unless coupled with the OYPR for the Plan, in which case the payment ceases at the end of the one year cycle along with the Plan itself). Examples of add-ons include ["**Additional Pages**"](#4-additional-pages) or [**Initial "Blog" or "Products" Page**](#5-blog-and-product-postings). An "additional subscription" is any subscription other than the Plan under the OYPR. Additional subscriptions constitute a *recurring payment* over an indefinite period of time (i.e., not confined to the scope of the Plan under the OYPR). Examples of additional subscriptions are [**"Website Management"**](#2-website-management), ["**Full Legal Compliance**"](#6-creation-of-terms-of-service-and-privacy-policy), ["**Accessibility Compliance**"](#9-accessibility-compliance) or [**"Blog/Product Posting"**](#5-blog-and-product-postings).

#### 8. Refunds and Cancellation
We currently allow cancellations and refunds if done under the following terms:

**In-House Programmer Package:**
You will receive a 100% refund if you cancel your plan within three days of the original purchase.
  - To do so you must contact us saying you wish to cancel and also provide your order number.

Beyond three days you might not receive any refund for the month in which the subscription was originally purchased. We encourage you to contact us anyway and hopefully we can work something out.

If you decide to cancel your subscription before the next billing cycle, you will retain our services for the duration of the paid for billing cycle. For the following billing cycle, you will no longer be charged and the services previously purchased from Osows will cease.
  - Any negotiated refund will be based on the amount of days since your original purchase and the labor already spent.
  - In most cases, however, you will not receive any refund beyond the three day mark.

**Professionally Coded Website Package:**
You will receive a 100% refund if you cancel your plan within three days of the original purchase.
  - To do so you must contact us saying you wish to cancel and also provide your order number.

Beyond three days you might not receive any refund. We encourage you to contact us anyway and hopefully we can work something out.
  - Any negotiated refund will be based on the amount of days since your original purchase and the labor already spent.
  - In most cases, however, you will not receive any refund beyond the three day mark.

If you decide to cancel your subscription before the end of the annual billing cycle, you will receive our services until said billing cycle ends. For the following billing cycle, you will no longer be charged and the services previously purchased from Osows will cease. If you have questions regarding the status of the website purchased from us after your subscription ends, see our [Plan Policy](../planpolicy/) page for more details.

If you have purchased the Professionally Coded Website on the monthly billing cycle, you are not allowed to cancel until the end of approximately one year of monthly billing cycles. This is because the cost of the website is the accumulation of one year's worth of monthly payments. If you decide to cancel, please contact us and we will tell you the date your subscription will end and when our services will cease (i.e. after one full year (12 months) of billing cycles have been completed).

---

#### 9. Accessibility Compliance
For $50/month, accessibility compliance can be added to your subscription. This is a recurring fee that extends beyond the end of date of the initial Subscription. You will be charged for as long as you desire it to exist on your Osows website.

Upon purchasing anything from Osows, and thereby agreeing to our Terms of Service, you also recognize that we have necessarily provided Accessibility Compliance (including but not limited to: ADA, WCAG, EEA compliance etc.) as an option, even should you not choose it.

To make your website accessible, we have partnered with [**accessiBe.com**](https://accessibe.com/).
