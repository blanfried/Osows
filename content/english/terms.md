#### 5. CANCELLATION AND PLAN POLICY

Upon payment for an Genyst Plan, and thereby agreeing with this Terms of Service, you accept the following Plan Policy.

These terms, developed below, cover our ["**Genyst Website Policy**"](#1-genyst-website-policy), ["**Genyst Website Management Policy**"](#2-genyst-website-management-policy), ["**Refunds and Cancellation Policy**"](#8-refunds-and-cancellation), as well as any additional purchases ("add-ons" or "additional subscriptions") that may be added onto the original "Plan" purchase and the terms which go along with each additional purchase. By "Plan" it is meant the original Genyst [**"Genyst Website"**](#1-genyst-website-policy) Plan, which is the base of all other additional subscriptions or add-ons. In order to purchase additional subscriptions, like [**"Genyst Website Management"**](#2-genyst-website-management) or add-ons, one must have either paid for the Plan "in Full" (see section 1) or currently be on or finished with the "One Year Payment Route" (OYPR) regarding the Plan (see section 1). An "add-on" is an addition to the Plan and constitutes a *one-time purchase* (i.e., not a recurring payment, unless coupled with the OYPR for the Plan, in which case the payment ceases at the end of the one year cycle along with the Plan itself). Examples of add-ons include ["**Additional Pages**"](#4-additional-pages) or [**Initial "Blog" or "Products" Page**](#5-blog-and-product-postings). An "additional subscription" is any subscription other than the Plan under the OYPR. Additional subscriptions constitute a *recurring payment* over an indefinite period of time (i.e., not confined to the scope of the Plan under the OYPR). Examples of additional subscriptions are [**"Genyst Website Management"**](#2-genyst-website-management), ["**Full Legal Compliance**"](#6-creation-of-terms-of-service-and-privacy-policy), ["**Accessibility Compliance**"](#9-accessibility-compliance) or [**"Blog/Product Posting"**](#5-blog-and-product-postings).

**In-House Programmer Package:**
You will receive a 100% refund if you cancel your plan within three days of the original purchase.
  - To do so you must contact us saying you wish to cancel and also provide your order number.

Beyond three days you might not receive any refund for the month in which the subscription was originally purchased. We encourage you to contact us anyway and hopefully we can work something out.

If you decide to cancel your subscription before the next billing cycle, you will retain our services for the duration of the paid for billing cycle. For the following billing cycle, you will no longer be charged and the services previously purchased from Genyst will cease.
  - Any negotiated refund will be based on the amount of days since your original purchase and the labor already spent.
  - In most cases, however, you will not receive any refund beyond the three day mark.

**Genyst Website Package:**
You will receive a 100% refund if you cancel your plan within three days of the original purchase.
  - To do so you must contact us saying you wish to cancel and also provide your order number.

Beyond three days you might not receive any refund. We encourage you to contact us anyway and hopefully we can work something out.
  - Any negotiated refund will be based on the amount of days since your original purchase and the labor already spent.
  - In most cases, however, you will not receive any refund beyond the three day mark.

If you decide to cancel your subscription before the end of the annual billing cycle, you will receive our services until said billing cycle ends. For the following billing cycle, you will no longer be charged and the services previously purchased from Genyst will cease. If you have questions regarding the status of the website purchased from us after your subscription ends, see our [Plan Policy](../planpolicy/) page for more details.

If you have purchased the Genyst Website on the monthly billing cycle, you are not allowed to cancel until the end of approximately one year of monthly billing cycles. This is because the cost of the website is the accumulation of one year's worth of monthly payments. If you decide to cancel, please contact us and we will tell you the date your subscription will end and when our services will cease (i.e. after one full year (12 months) of billing cycles have been completed).


##### 9. Accessibility Compliance
For $50/month, accessibility compliance can be added to your subscription. This is a recurring fee that extends beyond the end of date of the initial Subscription. You will be charged for as long as you desire it to exist on your Genyst website.

Upon purchasing anything from Genyst, and thereby agreeing to our Terms of Service, you also recognize that we have necessarily provided Accessibility Compliance (including but not limited to: ADA, WCAG, EEA compliance etc.) as an option, even should you not choose it.

To make your website accessible, we have partnered with [**accessiBe.com**](https://accessibe.com/).


##### 10. Designs
The credit for our Designs properly goes to:
- GetHugoThemes.com
- Themefisher.com

We have opted to host these sites as previews ourselves for cohesion purposes on Genyst.com. Our Web Developers are skilled in the conversion of these designs into new customized websites for our clients. We have all rights necessary to conduct said conversion for our clients and use these designs as we see fit.


##### 11. Money Back Guarantee

#### 15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
Informal Negotiations
To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a “Dispute” and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.

Binding Arbitration
If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Delaware. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in Delaware, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Legal Terms.

In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Services be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

Restrictions
The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration
The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
